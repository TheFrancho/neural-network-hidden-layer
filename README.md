# neural-network-hidden-layer

Single Hidden Layer Neural Network developed on Numpy for simple predictions.

The default dataset is based on a 2 numbers tuple, where the output shall be 1 if the sum of them is positive and 0 otherwise.

The dataset is generated randomly and the number of examples and training epochs can be set as well.

Feel free to play with this code.
